# Workshop for WUG

## THEORETICAL EXAMPLES
A participant will get familiar with following principles and technologies:

## Day 1 (2-3 hours)
**Knowledge level - low**
* terminology
  * transpiller 
  * polyfill
  * minification/uglification
  * ....
* ES6/2016
  * arrow functions
  * block scope
  * modules
  * template literals
  * ....

## Day 2 (3-4 hours)
**Knowledge level - higher**
* tools for development
  * chrome DevTools
  * node.js and ecosystem, simplification with tools such as:
    * gulp
    * babel
    * systemjs
    * webpack
    * lite-server
* mock and fetch data
  * create simple in memmory back end (with express route API)
  * fetch data with postman
  * how to leverage Promise/Observable for async request call

## Day 3 (3-4 hours)
**Knowledge level - low**    
* how to set up initial project with minimal effort
  * chose all packages for project needs e.g. underscore, angular, bootstrap, sass e.g.
  * prepare solution for task automation

**Knowledge level - higher**
* examples of JS principles and framework features
  * modularity
  * design patterns
  * separation of concerns
  * simple responsibility principle
  * data binding
  * event handling
  * data fetching
  * routing

**Knowledge level - high**
* create simple RESTfull web app with CRUD features with Angular and jQuery :
  * initial file structure
  * fetch hardcoded data from service 
  * data bind to list view (use bootstrap classes) 
  * alter data with 2way data binding
  * implement routing to display detail consumed from back end service
  * alter data detail and send them back to the server (use built in validation)

---

## PRACTICAL SESSION
Each participant will implement a web application capable of manage list of users with CRUD features. There will be a public API accessible to get and store data. 

## Day 4

#### features
* view list of users
* view detail of user
* update detail of a user
* create a new user
* delete a user

#### details
implementation will cover: 

* modularity
* reausability
* naming convetions
* project structuring
* reading and saving to external end point
* error handling
* UI features, lists, dialogs ...
